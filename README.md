# Coco-Recorder
Python3 script to record Kiryu Coco's live streams so that you don't miss any non archived streams
<br>
Requires Streamlink be installed
<br><br>
<b> Warning: </b>
<br>
This script uses a rather brute force method of getting the streams (it requests the page every 30 seconds until it gets a response) only run for short periods of time (YouTube <b>really</b> doesn't like you spaming its servers)
<br>
If you want to run it all the time I recommend using <a href="https://github.com/YUKI2eN3e/HoloLive-Recorder">HoloLive-Recorder</a> instead.
